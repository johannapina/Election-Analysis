    ## Challenge Overview
    - The main challenge with using Python aside from using the correct syntax, aligning the indentations correctly, otherwise the code will not work.
    
    ## Challenge Summary
    - Using VS Code, greatly helped with making the necessary edits for debugging the code since it facilitates using back spaces, which are not available in "Terminal".
